# Requirements

## Introduction
* A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers.
* The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* More sophisticated calculators can handle exponent ial operations, roots, logarithm s, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions.



## Research
* One of the most primitive calculators, the abacus.
## Cost and Features
### *Cost*
Since the system uses only open source software, it is free of cost..!!

*TBD*

### *Features*
The various features/options for interconversion of the system are:
1. Length
2. Area
3. Volume
4. Mass
5. Speed

## Defining the System

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

The tool is a helping hand for young children who would like to counter verify their conversions and also for scientific researchers and mathematicians.

## What:

A metric conversion calculator that does metric conversions in few seconds.

## When:

When people are struggling with simple conversions or when kids would like to cross verify their answers while practicing or when people need conversion results in a jiffy to proceed on further with their calculations. 

## Where:

Can be put to use where simple or advanced scientific and mathematic calculations requiring conversions are involved.

## How:

The system opens up to the standard list of metric conversions that are available. Upon selection of one the standard system, the list of inter-conversions i.e., the sub-system is shown on the screen. The user can now choose one sub unit that needs to be converted into one or more other sub units that is available on the list.  The results for all these conversions are flashed in a second.
